# Alphacast's Open-Source Connectors CodeBase

This is the main repository from where we manage the work behind Alphacast, a collaboration platform for creating, sharing and monetizing decision-making data and analysis. In the Alphacast's Open-Source Connectors CodeBase you can find thousands of hours of work of our team and the community.

Our database grows on a daily basis but we will be happy if you want to help us in our endevour.

## What is the Alphacast's Open-Source Connectors CodeBase?

1. We have begun the process of opening our codeBase. Explore the repositories to find examples, ideas and inspiration! All the code and data created in this project will be open and free!
2. Anyone can upload, share and monetize their data in Alphacast but please, read the [Terms & Conditions](https://www.alphacast.io/terms). Don't share or upload data that you do not own or that you do not have the right to share.
3. We review and validate the code to confirm that they do what they say they do. The code is then run routinely (hourly, daily, weekly) to keep the data updated on our Certified Datasets. You can also use the codes in this codeBase to create you own datasets and repos.  
4. We support the work of our contributtors. Write to hello@alphacast.io to know more about this.
